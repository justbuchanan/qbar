Items:
* Make battery item actually work
* network up/down
* disk I/O
* disk usage - red for warning?
* launcher items?
* Audio/Volume
    * make AlsaVolume more configurable
    * PulseVolume item?
* Bspwm improvements
    * if no screen specified, use the one the bar is on
    * better icons for desktops
* spotify visualizer?
* Memory bar isn't right...

* add free icons

* ability to specify masked image icon path easily

* window-manager aware?  how to auto-pad to account for the bar?

* CI status indicator.  Give it a list of projects on circleci or travis-ci to check.  only be good if all are good, show a dropdown list with the broken builds at the top.  say when it was last checked and have a button to refresh.


* resolve the screen index mismatch between qt and bspwm


* unify desktop naming


Implement bspwm reloading:

Config
* config in python instead of yaml?
    * take a look at qtile for inspiration
    * just a python script that defines @items
* appropriate error msg for missing params in config file for bar items
* set icons for things through css
* set height and bottom/top through config file?
* catch and log exceptions gracefully when loading config file
* use css for bar spacing and height, not cmd flags?

Layout:
* be able to center content
    * the Spacer item doesn't quite work for this
Style
* customize height with css
* hover styles?
* good default light and dark themes, with cmd-line switch?
* use css to change bspwm items and such based on pseudoclasses for focused, occupied, etc
* use css to set icons?

* customizable margins/spacing

Bugs:
* stop immediately on ctrl+c, don't wait for timers to end
* ctrl+c only works when there's a timer-based item

Other:
* preexec?
* right click and left click
* multi-monitor
* stylable Separator Items between main items?
* graceful shutdown

Menu functionality
* easily navigable with keyboard
* Define actions for items

Testing:
* test css, config reload?
* test geometry?
* start/stop?


Semi-relevant ideas:
* widgets for the minimalist linux desktop
* weather widget - what api?
* transparent, but sample background?  for bar
* draw swap and mem in the same bar graph?
* logout, reboot, shutdown buttom / menu in the corner
